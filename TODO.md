# Todo

- [x] fix `mouse_delta`
- [ ] `key_released`
  - Tricky because GLFW does not handle release for char codes
- [ ] svg export does not use the background
- [x] Check transparent image load/render
- [ ] merge + update PyPi to develop
- [x] get parameters gui to be toggable
  - `toggle_gui()`
- [ ] place the sketch in the upper left corner when in fullscreen, rather than bottom left?
  - Check should be centered
  
# Maybe
- [ ] change `draw_gl` to `render` ? Also might be worth having two callbacks, one overlayed on under.
